## Requirements :  
                1) Numpy (pip install numpy)
                2) cv2 (pip install opencv-python)
                3) json
                4) tqdm
                5) pygame
                6) keyboard
                7) json
                8) Pillow
                9) opencv-python

## Help :
  0) [Optional] You can change in 'user editable area' in main.py file
  
  1) first recoord coordinates with "Draw" button or load image with "Image" button.
  2) Put reference image in file location and if file exists then, It will detect edge of objects in image and return cords.
  3) Or Draw something on board by dragging mouse.
  4) You can Undo with "X" for single point undo or "Z" for redo , "S" is for save and "R" to stop rotation

  5) After input we have to arrange cords in pattern for drawing, Also have to remove repeated cords and minimize large size.
     So select any "Keep" or "Remove" and type needed percentage, press ">" button.
  6) *You can undo cords alterations using "Undo" button. It only works for once.*
     
  7) Lastly press "fftx" button for arms draw.
